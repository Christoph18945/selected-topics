"""Builder Method

It is a Creation Design Pattern which aims to "Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
so that the same construction process can create different representations." It allows you to construct complex
objects step by step. Here using the same construction code, we can produce different types and representations of the object easily.

It is basically designed to provide flexibility to the solutions to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming.

Advantages of using Builder Method:
Reusability: While making the various representations of the products, we can use the same construction code for other representations as well.
Single Responsibility Principle: We can separate out both the business logic as well as the complex construction code from each other.
Construction of the object: Here we construct our object step by step, defer construction steps or run steps recursively.

Disadvantages of using Builder method:
Code complexity increases: The complexity of our code increases, because the builder pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
Mutability: It requires the builder class to be mutable
Initialization: Data members of the class are not guaranteed to be initialized.

Applicability:
Constructing Complex objects : The Builder Method allows you to construct the products step-by-step. Even, we can defer the
execution of some steps without breaking the final product. To create an object tree, it is handy to call the steps recursively.It prevents the client code from fetching the incomplete data because it doesnâ€™t allow the exposing of an unfinished object.
Differ by Representations: The Builder pattern is applicable when construction of various representations of the product involves
similar steps that differ only in the details. The base builder interface is used to define all the construction steps while these steps are implemented by concrete builders.
